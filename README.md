Blockchain-Based Healthcare Data Management Platform
This platform leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure and decentralized solution for managing healthcare data. It allows patients to store and control access to their health records while ensuring privacy, data integrity, and streamlined access for healthcare providers.

With this platform, patients can have complete control over who can access their medical information. The platform uses smart contracts to manage consent and data-sharing agreements, ensuring data remains secure and tamper-proof. Every data transaction and access request is logged, providing a comprehensive audit trail for transparency and accountability.

This solution aims to bridge the gap between multiple healthcare systems by offering interoperability with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and promoting a patient-centered approach to health data management.
